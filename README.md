## 📜 Project Overview

Traffic congestion is a persistent challenge in urban areas, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and environmental pollution. This **Traffic Flow Optimization** project aims to tackle these issues using **data-driven algorithms** and **machine learning techniques** to improve traffic flow, optimize signal timing, and reduce congestion. Leveraging a background in civil engineering and data science, this project integrates real-world traffic data with advanced modeling to create a smart traffic management solution.

## 🚀 Objectives

1. **Optimize Traffic Signal Timing**: Reduce waiting time at intersections through algorithmic signal control.
2. **Predict Traffic Congestion**: Build predictive models for real-time congestion management and route adjustment.
3. **Provide Data-Driven Insights**: Use data analytics to uncover patterns and optimize long-term traffic management strategies.

📊 Key Components
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to understand traffic volume patterns, peak congestion times, and external factors influencing traffic (e.g., weather conditions). Key insights are documented in notebooks/EDA.ipynb.

2. Traffic Signal Optimization
Using Reinforcement Learning (RL), an adaptive traffic signal control system was designed to minimize wait times. This model improved intersection efficiency by up to 15% in simulated tests. Relevant code can be found in src/signal_optimization.py.

3. Congestion Prediction Model
Implemented a Random Forest and LSTM model to forecast congestion levels based on traffic data and weather patterns. These models achieved a high accuracy in predicting peak congestion hours, reducing travel time by an average of 10% in congested routes. Full implementation is in src/congestion_prediction.py.

4. Real-Time Route Adjustment
The project includes an algorithm for recommending alternate routes during high traffic, allowing drivers to bypass congestion areas effectively. This is part of our congestion management system, with results and performance metrics noted in reports/final_report.md.

✅ Results and Impact
Signal Optimization: Reduced waiting times at intersections by 15%.
Congestion Prediction: Achieved 10% improvement in travel times during peak hours.
Data Insights: Identified key factors influencing traffic, such as weather, day of the week, and time of day, aiding in long-term planning and resource allocation.
Sample Visualizations
Analysis of traffic volume variations across different days and times.

📈 Future Scope
Scalability: Implement and monitor in real-time traffic management systems.
Enhanced Data Collection: Integrate GPS data, live construction, and accident reports.
Driver Feedback Mechanism: Allow real-time feedback to improve rerouting recommendations.
